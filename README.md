# Installation of the database in your university server
Because we are using the same PHPMyadmin for all users in the university server, there are some
changes to the SQL script. Please make sure that you follow this part before doing the exercise
below.
  1. Open file create_db_template.sql in Visual Studio Code
  2. Replace xxxx with your student ID (Your username for login to the PhPMyAdmin)
     
      To prevent mistake, please use the function Replace in your editor
      *in Visual Studio Code (Edit â†’ Replace, or CTRL+h)
